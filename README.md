# Movies
Simple Android movies app using MVVM clean architecture.
The idea was to develop a simple application that consumes a public API to display movies.
<br><br>

## Build the application
clone https://github.com/tiagoivasco/MoviesTest

### 2. Configure the project

The movies information provided in this application belongs to **themoviedb.org**, so you need an API Key from their platform in order to display it. You can get one from [this link](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction).
Update the _keystore.properties_ with the provided key.
```
THE_MOVIE_DB_API_KEY=API KEY HERE
```

### 2. Points to improve
